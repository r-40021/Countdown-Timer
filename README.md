# How to Use
**It is very simple to use.**  
1. Set the time you want the alarm to go off.
2. Press the SET button.
# Features
1. This app is a good combination of an alarm clock and a timer.
2. The set time is stored in the parameter.
3. The remaining time will be reflected in the page title in real time, so you will know how much time is left even if you are working on something else.
