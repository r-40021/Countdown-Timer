# Features
1. This app is a good combination of an alarm clock and a timer.

3. The remaining time will be reflected in the page title in real time, so you will know how much time is left even if you are working on something else.
4. You can change the alarm sound to whatever you want.
5. You will receive a push notification when the time is up. (PC only)
6. The device will not sleep while you are using this app.
7. You can make this app full screen. So, it is suitable for projecting this application on a display.
